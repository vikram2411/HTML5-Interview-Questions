<!doctype html>
<html>
 <head>
<meta charset = “UTF-8”>
<title> MathMl Example </title>
</head>
<body>
 
<math xmlns=<a href="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML">http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML</a>”>
<mrow>
<mrow>
<msup>
<mi> a </mi>
<mn> 2 </mn>
</msup>
<mo> + </mo>
<mrow>
<mn> 2 </mn>
<mo> </mo>
<mi> b </mi>
</mrow>
<mo> + </mo>
<mn> 5 </mn>
</mrow>
<mo> = </mo>
<mn> 0 </mn>
</mrow>
</math>

<img src = “image.png” alt = “Wiki” border = “0/”>
</a>
</body>
</html>
Q #16) Explain the concept of web storage in HTML5.

Answer: Web storage provides the facility to store the data of our web applications locally into the user’s browser. It can store up to 10 MB data. Web storage helps to increase the performance of our applications.

There are two types of web storage that are used to store data locally in HTML5:

Local storage: This stores the data that will not expire or clear automatically when a user closes or reopens a browser.
Session Storage: This stores data for one session only(i.e, a user who is surfing the internet or website). Once the browser is closed, session data will automatically delete from the web browser.
Q #17) Explain Geolocation API in HTML5.

Answer: Geolocation API is used to locate a user’s geographical position.

For privacy reasons, the user is asked for permission to report the location information. Use the navigator.geolocation.get current position() method to get the user’s position and geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude number).

For example, to Return the latitude and longitude position of a user is shown below.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<p>Click The My Location Button to get your Location.</p>
<button onclick="getLocation()"> My Location </button>
<p id="location"></p>
<script>
var x = document.getElementById("location");
function getLocation() {
if (navigator.geolocation) {
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(showPosition);
} else {
x.innerHTML = "Geolocation is not supported by this browser.";
}
}
function showPosition(position) {
x.innerHTML = "Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude +
"<br>Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude;
}
</script>
</body>
</html>
Example Explained:

Check, if Geolocation is supported or not.
If Geolocation is supported, run the getCurrentPosition() method. If Geolocation is not supported, display the error message to the user.
If getCurrentPosition() method is successful, it returns coordinates and functions specified in the parameter.
The showPosition() function, gets the output – Longitude and Latitude.
Q #18) Explain HTML5 Graphics.

Answer: HTML5 supports two types of graphics i.e. Canvas and SVG.

a) Canvas: <canvas> element is used to design graphics on the web page, and it has several methods available for drawing circles, boxes, adding images and text. 300 px X 150 px (width X height) is the default pixel size of canvas.

Example to Draw square Box using canvas element is shown below.

#mycanvas{border:2px solid pink;}
</style>
</head>
<body>
<canvas id = “mycanvas” width = “150” height = “150”></canvas>
</body>
</html>
b) SVG: <svg> Scalable Vector Graphics, are mostly used for graphical application and scalable vector type diagrams, such as X, Y coordinate system, two-dimensional and pie charts. This makes it faster and lightweight. SVG follows XML format.

Example to draw a Rectangle using SVG element is shown below.

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<svg width = “400” height = “150”>
<rect width = “400” height = “150” style = “fill:rgb(200,220,255);stroke-width:10;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)”/>
</svg>
</body>
</html>
